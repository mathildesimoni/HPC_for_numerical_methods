# HPC_for_numerical_methods
Gathers the code and report for the 2 projects in the class `HPC for numerical methods and data analysis` at EPFL.

- The first project was individual. It implements and compares 3 different algorithms (Classical Gram-Schmidt, Cholesky-QR and TSQR) to compute the thin QR factorization of a matrix.
- The second project was implemented in a group of 2 students. It implements and investigates the numerical stability and parallel performance of the randomized Nystr√∂m algorithm used to compute rank-k approximations of a square positive semi-definite matrix.
